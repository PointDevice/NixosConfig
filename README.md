# NixOS Config 
---

This repo stores my very messy config for NixOS

This is mostly for my use to have offsite versioning 

If you intend to use this config yourself, please make sure to check over all of it before doing so 

These configs use a lot of baked names (mostly in reference to username) that I am in the process of changing
